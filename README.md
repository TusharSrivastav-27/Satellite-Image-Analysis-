# Satellite-Image-Analysis-

We have to make a model which will identify different 
objects like buildings, highways, sealake etc by using 
images from the satellite. 
Here we have taken the dataset from EuroSat which is 
open source and trained it using Deeplearning.

Our model can predict 3 categories from the satellite images i.e Residential area, Sealake and Highways. We can increase it's number of classes to detect more categories like stadium, car etc.
